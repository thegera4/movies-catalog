# movies-catalog
Small console application made with java OOP concepts. This app uses layers to separate data connection logic, business logic and client views.

It presents to the user a small menu to select an option:

![menu](https://github.com/thegera4/movies-catalog/assets/84020433/d686b68b-e504-4e1d-8108-deb04d992e1d)

You have to initialize a catalog, so press "1" first:

![initizalize](https://github.com/thegera4/movies-catalog/assets/84020433/ce664b05-6fcd-4a7a-ad9f-c1d3cc31d286)

With this option, a file will be created, in order to store the data that you are going to add with option "2":

![created_file](https://github.com/thegera4/movies-catalog/assets/84020433/6ee3ce15-deea-4173-af1b-4935cb689342)

So you can start adding moviees with option "2":

![added_movie](https://github.com/thegera4/movies-catalog/assets/84020433/93e6e07a-08d2-4092-b06e-49cb02940430)

And you can open the created file to check if the data was stored correctly:

![text_saved_in_file](https://github.com/thegera4/movies-catalog/assets/84020433/1a5f5836-1702-489a-ab73-24e0445925a4)

After adding all the movies that you want, you can list them with option "3":

![list](https://github.com/thegera4/movies-catalog/assets/84020433/9ac86693-54ac-4315-bdc5-4a47c0b74d24)

By using option "4" you can search for a movie. If the movie is in the catolog it will list it, if not, it will show a not found message:

![not found](https://github.com/thegera4/movies-catalog/assets/84020433/b9efb8d8-c762-40ae-a883-82380db5b62d)

Finally, option "0" is used to stop the program:

![exit](https://github.com/thegera4/movies-catalog/assets/84020433/4163c175-f8f2-4794-b467-2a8ac0e5d492)
